Question:
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

Approach:
Traverse the given array and store the compliment(the other part required to sum up to the given target sum) of each element in a
HashMap as a key for that element.While we traverse through the given array keep on checking if the element has its key already in the
HashMap before updating its key.If the key exists, it means the element has its compliment in the Array and then we can print the
currently checked element along with the value of its compliment key present in HashMap.


Complexity Analysis:
Time complexity for traversing each element of the array: O(n)
Time complexity for adding and checking each element's compliment: O(1)
Therefore, total time complexity is O(n).

Space Complexity is O(n) as we will be creating another HashMap to store the elements along with its compliment.
